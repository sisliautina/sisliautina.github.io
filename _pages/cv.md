**[Model Stokastik Tipe SIRV pada Penyebaran COVID-19 dengan Mempertimbangkan Efektivitas Vaksinasi](https://doi.org/10.14421/fourier.2022.111.7-16)**
* In this research, the SIRV model was used to examine the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission with two stages of vaccination: the first dose and the second dose.
* The model analysis involved determining the basic reproduction number, followed by identifying transition probabilities and the likelihood of an outbreak using the stochastic approach of Continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC).
* Data analysis was carried out manually and using software such as Python, Microsoft Excel, and RStudio to visually represent the dynamics of disease transmission.
